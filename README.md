# ROG 7.1 Headset Speaker Switch
## Short description:
This is a PowerShell script to switch from headset to speaker (and back) on the ASUS ROG 7.1 Centurion. This eliminates the need to manually switch from headset to speaker in the ROG 7.1 software (or on the USB sound station) to use the other sound device.

The PowerShell script itself was converted to Base64 in the batch file to have everything needed in the batch file, so only the batch file is needed. This can be copied to the desktop for example and is executed there with a double click.
